# Circle Of Fifths

> An interactive game that challenges the player to create a melody in a given key. Player must follow the standard scale of the key based upon the principles of the circle of fifths in music theory.

> Player has 5 different "rooms", with specific instruments, which will feature present player with a given set of notes in a music scale. Player will have 8 different boxes where the Player can choose what note they want to add. After each box has a given note, the Player then enters the next room. Once the Player completes all 5 rooms, the value of the melodies is compiled into a total number of points. The objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible and reach the "Grammy" level.

> The Player must be careful to only implement the correct notes in a given scale for their melody. Off-keys will subtract points. Points will only be tallied after all 5 rooms have been
completed.

> -**Brew**-The entire 8-block melody.

> -**Concoction**-The entire 5-Elixir mix of melodies.

> -**Points**-The total value of the Concoction, calculated by the correct/incorrect Elixir choices.
